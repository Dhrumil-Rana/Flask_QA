<p align="center">This Social Media project is for Steam users who love to buy/sell their Counter-Strike skins on the Steam platform. This project will help users market their skins in a different way. You can also chat with your friends and search through the most popular Steam Community Market items for Counter-Strike.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Steam Community Market users would like to showcase and share their skins that are for sale through screenshots, public posts and friends in a way that is similar to social media platforms, and the current implementation on Steam does not work this way. This project is a web application that provides an interface for this while also acting as a social media platform complete with profiles, friends, messaging, image/text posts and comments.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
This project uses postgreSQL and you need to create a database and then run the queries from **table.sql** to create a table.

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv <name>
Activate it:
./<name>/bin/activate

Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Flask app locally:
flask run
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- User needs to register first. Don't add your password directly in the database as I am using the bycrpyt to  encrypt the passwords. You need to give them the steam id as a mandatory field. Here is the sample steam id: 76561198262264130

- It is used for gamers to show their skins to other friends and it will also help users to talk about the skin they have bought or sold.
